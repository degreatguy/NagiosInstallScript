# NagiosInstallScript
This install is currently for Ubuntu at the moment 14.04, 16.04 and 18.4
All Software Rights of Nagios core belong to Nagios
I have just built a script to Simplify my install with the help of thier KB
I have tested this on VMware Workstation with Guest OS Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

This is My First Script Created for install, would love to hear any input I get!
